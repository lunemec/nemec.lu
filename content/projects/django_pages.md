A small and simple CMS (content management system) like Drupal, Joomla, WordPress.

It may not have as much plugins and templates like WordPress but it is super simple application with django admin with WYSIWYG editors for page and post editing.

It is designed for easy web content editing with no previous experience in HTML or CSS. Just install it once, use default template or create one for yourself (or hire someone to make it) and use it. There is no maintenance required.

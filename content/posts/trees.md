First, watch this video.

Think about it. The tree is made from *CO2 + water + sun energy + little bit of 
nutrients* . But, that is not all. Let's think further about how amazing trees are.

# What do trees "eat"
So trees need *air, water, sun, nutrients*.

Trees use CO2 during daylight to initiate [*photosynthesis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis).
Basically, they use what living things on earth exhale and can't use to *grow* themselves. And
also they create *oxygen* for **us** to breathe.

**Wow.**

Hmm, what are those nutrients from [soil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil) I wonder? Wikipedia says:
*Soil is a mixture of minerals, organic matter, gases, liquids, and countless organisms that together support life on Earth.*

Besides all the basic elements that are found in *soil*, it is also made from:
*Soil organic matter is made up of organic compounds and includes plant, animal and microbial material, both living and dead.*

This means trees *consume* what we can't, they *consume* our dead bodies, and those of other organisms, to *photosynthesise*, which
in turn keeps all life on Earth alive.

**Wow.**

# Condensed energy
If you'd take the wood tree is made from, let it dry, you'd get  *CO2 + sun energy + ~~water~~*.
And what would happen, if you'd say, put this dried material into fire while having access
to some oxygen? It would **release** the sun energy back in form of heat + CO2 as a smoke.

And if you bury the trees deep in earth, they form [coal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal), which
you can again burn to release the sun energy in form of heat.

**Wow.**

# Thoughts
This might be the best example of [symbiosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiosis) I have ever seen.
It makes me wonder, how is it possible, that this great machine we call *life* came to be? These complex
processes that make one organism provide for other organisms and vice versa. This is amazing.
